        "content": "Why are you running to be Groom's local MP? Sandra Jephcott: I am a veterinarian and farmer and live on a 4000-hectare property west of Toowoomba. I have a broad range of experiences that I can bring to the role of federal MP [Member of Parliament]. When approached by the Sustainable Australia Party to run and help to raise awareness for our party, I was very happy to contribute. I believe that the Groom by-election offers voters an opportunity to send a message to the two major parties that we're not happy with business as usual politics - including rampant overdevelopment and systemic political corruption that negatively impacts on the environment. Wikinews: You've said that you want to act on climate change - what would your plan be? Sandra Jephcott: There is no silver bullet to addressing climate change. Sustainable Australia Party has a holistic plan to act on climate change, including: Funding and subsidising research and development into renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency initiatives; Net zero or net negative Australian greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (or ideally sooner); Imposing a moratorium on all new coal mines in Australia such as Adani (and all major coal mine expansions such as New Acland) Imposing a moratorium on all new fracking, including for coal seam gas; Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies; Adopting a globally-consistent carbon pricing mechanism that does not unfairly penalise Australian industries; Promoting the environmental benefits of plant-based food; and Lowering population growth pressures.",
